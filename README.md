# UNIQLO Akamai T-shirt Code

## Overview
A Japanese fashion brand called UNIQLO collaborated with an Internet company called Akamai to design a T-shirt.  

The design of the T-shirt is based on a Go program.  
However, it is also a piece of missing Go language code.  

So, the missing parts were filled in and the code was supplemented so that it would work.  

Then, the program for a simple server was restored.  

I would like to introduce this code, including how to use it, below.

## Output Sample
Since this code is a program for a server, the code is invoked on the console on the left.  
The console on the left is a temporary server.  

The console on the right is the client side, executing curl commands.  

This program responds with ACTIVE while processing on the server and INACTIVE while waiting.
